            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury.</p>

            <p>In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the <em>Red Planet</em></p> 
            <p>because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance </p>
            <p>that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.</p>

        <h2 style=" color: #d33d1f;"> Orbit and rotation </h2>

        <h3> Rotation </h3>

            <p>Mars's average distance from the Sun is roughly 230 million km (143 million mi), and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. </p>
                <p>The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. </p>
                <p>A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.</p>

            <p> The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees relative to its orbital plane, which is similar to the axial tilt of Earth. 
                <p>As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer.</p> 
                <p>In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb.</p>

        <h3> Orbit </h3>

            <p>Mars has a relatively pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.09; of the seven other planets in the Solar System, 
                <p>only Mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity. </p>
                <P>It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much more circular orbit. </p>
                <p>At one point, 1.35 million Earth years ago, Mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002, much less than that of Earth today. </p>
                <p>Mars's cycle of eccentricity is 96,000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years. </p>
                <p>Mars has a much longer cycle of eccentricity, with a period of 2.2 million Earth years, and this overshadows the 96,000-year cycle in the eccentricity graphs. </p>
                <p>For the last 35,000 years, the orbit of Mars has been getting slightly more eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the other planets. 
                <p>The closest distance between Earth and Mars will continue to mildly decrease for the next 25,000 years.</p>
